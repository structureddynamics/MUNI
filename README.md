# MUNI

The MUNI Ontology is a modified version of the Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary (IPSV) from the United Kingdom (see http://doc.esd.org.uk/IPSV/2.00.html), for which many thanks are offered. MUNI has modified this vocabulary to include North American concepts, to internationalize spellings, and to remove UK-specific considerations. MUNI has also been extended in the specific areas of community indicator systems (CISs). As a community-supported initiative, we anticipate MUNI to continue to diverge from IPSV over time. However, links are also maintained to the IPSV identifiers.
